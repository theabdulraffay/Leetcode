<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<p>You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.</p>
<p>You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [7,8,0,7]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [8,0,7]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0]
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].</li>
<li>0 ≤ Node.val ≤ 9</li>
<li>It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Follow up:</strong> Could you solve it without reversing the input lists?</p>

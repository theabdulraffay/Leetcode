<h3>Easy</h3>
<hr>
<p>Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.</p>
<p>The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.</p>
<p>The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
</pre>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].</li>
<li>-100 <= Node.val <= 100</li>
</ul>
